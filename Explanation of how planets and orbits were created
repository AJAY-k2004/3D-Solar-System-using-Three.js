üåç Explanation: How Planets and Orbits Were Created

1. Used Three.js for 3D Modeling
   - The entire solar system was built using the Three.js library, which simplifies 3D object creation and animation in the browser.

2. Created the Planets as 3D Spheres
   - Each planet (Mercury to Neptune) was created using SphereGeometry, which forms a round 3D object.
   - Realistic textures (images of actual planets) were applied to each sphere for visual accuracy.

3. Positioned Planets Around the Sun
   - Planets were placed at different distances from the Sun using .position.set(x, y, z) to represent their orbits.

4. Used Orbit Containers for Circular Movement
   - Each planet was placed inside a parent Object3D container.
   - This container rotates around the Sun, making the planet appear to orbit it naturally.

5. Simulated Planetary Spin (Self-Rotation)
   - The planet meshes themselves rotate on their own Y-axis to mimic each planet‚Äôs spinning motion.

6. Drew Orbit Paths Using Line Loops
   - Circular orbit paths were visualized using 100+ points around the Sun.
   - These points were connected using THREE.LineLoop to form a ring showing the planet's path.

7. Animated Using requestAnimationFrame and THREE.Clock
   - Continuous animation was achieved using a render loop that updates the orbit and rotation speeds based on time.
